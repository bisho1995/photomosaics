# photomosaics
I shall be posting two images as demo. First is raw image, second is the edited image. The second image looks black and white when seen for the first time. Take a closer look, zoom in and you can see it is actually made up of a number of small images which have no relation to the final image, but when placed side by side they make up the original image.

## How does this work ?
It works on the principle that we can approximate the color of an image by calculating its pixel value. Now if we put these images in place of pixel or group of pixel we can obtain the original image.
